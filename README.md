📱 Smart Calculator
📖 Project Description

The Smart Calculator is a modern web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It performs not only basic arithmetic operations but also advanced mathematical functions like square, cube, factorial, and even/odd detection. The calculator has a clean UI with glowing buttons, smooth hover effects, and proper error handling for invalid inputs (like division by zero or factorial of a negative number).

The project is simple yet powerful, making it a perfect combination of design + logic building in JavaScript.
