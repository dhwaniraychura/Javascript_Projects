ðŸ“Œ Project: Smart Travel Planner

The Smart Travel Planner is a JavaScript-based project designed to make trip planning simple and interactive. The program asks the user for key details such as the number of destinations (between 3â€“5), the travel budget (minimum â‚¹1000), and the number of days they want to travel (1â€“100). Each input is carefully validated using loops and conditions to ensure only correct values are accepted. For example, destination names are restricted to letters only, the budget must be sufficient, and days must fall within the given range.

Once all inputs are collected, the program generates personalized travel suggestions. Based on the budget, it recommends whether the user should plan a short domestic trip, a long domestic trip, or an international trip. The number of days determines whether the trip is categorized as a Weekend Getaway, a Perfect Holiday, or an Extended Vacation. Additionally, a hotel recommendation system calculates the average spending per day and suggests Budget, Mid-range, or Luxury Hotels accordingly.

The final output is displayed in two ways:

On the Webpage â€“ as a clear and attractive travel summary with all details listed.

In the Console â€“ for developers to check the structured output with formatted logs.

This project helped me practice JavaScript fundamentals such as loops, conditions, functions, and regular expressions. It also improved my ability to handle input validation, decision-making, and user interaction through prompts and alerts. Overall, the Smart Travel Planner is a practical project that combines logic with real-world application to give users a quick and useful travel plan.
