Smart_Cafe_Billing_System

Project Description:
This project is a JavaScript-based Cafe Management System designed to simulate real cafe operations through a console interface. Users can place multiple orders from a predefined menu, with the system calculating the subtotal, adding 5% GST, and generating the final bill. It features an automated discount system based on the purchase amount, a secure password change option with strict validation rules, and a sales report that shows total items sold along with the highest and lowest-priced items. The program runs in a continuous loop, ensuring smooth, interactive, and user-friendly operation until the user decides to exit.
