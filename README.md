Smart_Calculator

ðŸ“Œ Project Description: Smart Calculator

The Smart Calculator is a web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus with an easy-to-use interface.

The design includes a modern gradient background, styled buttons with hover effects, and a clear input display that mimics the look and feel of a real calculator. Users can reset calculations with AC, remove the last digit with DEL, and work with decimals.

Key Features:

Supports operations: +, -, *, /, %

Handles decimal values

Clear (AC) and Delete (DEL) functions

Input length limitation for error-free usage

Simple and clean UI with hover animations

This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and expression evaluation in JavaScript, making it a great beginner project for front-end development practice.
