Result Score Board

Project Description :
The Result Scoreboard with API is a JavaScript-based web application that allows users to sign up, log in, and manage student result records securely. Only authenticated users can access their personal result dashboard, where they can add, edit, delete, search, filter, and sort student results. The app integrates with an API to store and fetch data for users and results, ensuring persistence. It features a responsive, clean Bootstrap UI with proper validation and error handling for a smooth user experience.
