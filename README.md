📸 Smart Image Slider
📌 Project Description

The Smart Image Slider is a mini JavaScript project that displays images one by one using a Bootstrap carousel layout. The images are stored in an array of objects, where each object contains an image URL and a caption.

Users can:

Navigate through slides using Next and Previous buttons.

See captions and a slide counter (e.g., Slide 2 of 5).

Add new images and captions through an input form, which automatically updates the slider.

🎯 Features

Array + Objects → Store all images with captions.

Navigation System → Next/Prev with boundary alerts (“This is the first/last slide”).

Display Function → Dynamically updates image, caption, and counter in the DOM.

User Input → Add new images with custom captions.

Bootstrap Carousel → Clean and responsive design.
