# Smart_Life_Assistance
This JavaScript code is a menu-driven “Smart Life Assistant” with four features:

🏃‍♂️ Fitness Suggestion System – Takes age and weight, checks against age-wise healthy weight ranges, and alerts if the user is Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese.

💸 Monthly Budget Planner – Takes monthly income and gives spending/saving advice based on income ranges.

📱 Mobile Data Usage Alert System – Takes monthly data usage in GB, compares with limits, and alerts usage status (Normal, Heavy, Extreme, or Exceeded Limit).

🔐 Change Password Logic – Validates old password, confirms new one, ensures it’s different, checks length (≥8) and strength (capital letter, special character, digit), then updates it.

It uses alert() for displaying messages and prompt() for user inputs, with input validation in every section.
